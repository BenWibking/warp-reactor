## Build

CPU build:

```bash
c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -I. reproducer.cpp -o reproducer
```

Mojo CPU build:

```bash
pixi run mojo build reproducer.mojo -o reproducer_mojo -Xlinker -lm
```

CUDA build with the default project settings:

```bash
nvcc -x cu -std=c++20 -O3 -arch=sm_90 --expt-relaxed-constexpr --fmad=false --maxrregcount=255 -DPRIMORDIAL_ROS2S_ENABLE_CUDA -DPRIMORDIAL_ROS2S_CUDA_THREADS_PER_BLOCK=128 -I. reproducer.cpp -o reproducer_cuda
```

HIP build with the default project settings:

```bash
hipcc -x hip -std=c++20 -O3 --offload-arch=gfx90a -DPRIMORDIAL_ROS2S_ENABLE_HIP -DPRIMORDIAL_ROS2S_CUDA_THREADS_PER_BLOCK=128 -I. reproducer.cpp -o reproducer_hip
```

## Run

Run the CPU reproducer:

```bash
./reproducer
```

Run the Mojo CPU reproducer:

```bash
./reproducer_mojo --grid 1 --no-compare-final-state
```

Compare C++ and Mojo transcendental functions over sampled Float64 inputs:

```bash
pixi run probe-transcendentals
```

This probe samples across the full Float64 exponent range, edge cases, focused
neighborhoods, and random bit patterns. It is not an exhaustive enumeration of
all legal Float64 values.

Run the CUDA reproducer:

```bash
./reproducer_cuda
```

Run the HIP reproducer:

```bash
./reproducer_hip
```

# Extra options

Show the available options:

```bash
./reproducer --help
```

By default, the run uses a `64^3` cell grid, enables deterministic density
perturbations, and compares the final state against
`final_states_grid64_cpu.bin`. To run without any reference comparison:

```bash
./reproducer --no-compare-final-state
./reproducer_cuda --no-compare-final-state
./reproducer_hip --no-compare-final-state
```

To run a smaller case:

```bash
./reproducer --grid 1 --no-compare-final-state
./reproducer_cuda --grid 1 --no-compare-final-state
./reproducer_hip --grid 1 --no-compare-final-state
```

For a `--grid 1` run, the program prints the final representative cell state
directly. For larger grids, it writes a packed binary final-state file named
`final_states_grid<N>_<backend>.bin`, for example
`final_states_grid64_cpu.bin`, `final_states_grid64_cuda.bin`, or
`final_states_grid64_hip.bin`. If that output file already exists, the old file
is moved aside with an `.old.<suffix>` name.

## Output

The main progress and summary fields are:

- `grid`: the requested cubic grid size and total cell count.
- `perturbations`: whether deterministic density perturbations were enabled.
- `completed global collapse steps`: the number of global collapse iterations
  completed before every cell stopped or a failure occurred.
- `cell completed steps`, `cell physical time`, and `cell density driver`: for
  multi-cell runs these are printed as `[min, median, max]`; for one-cell runs
  the representative cell values are printed directly.
- `wall time`: elapsed host wall-clock time for the integration loop.
- `ROS2S internal steps`, `rhs calls`, `jacobian calls`, `decompositions`,
  `linear solves`, and `accepted/rejected`: integrator work counters. Multi-cell
  runs print `[min, median, max]`; one-cell runs print totals.

If final-state comparison is enabled, the program also prints:

- `final-state comparison file`: the reference file used.
- `final-state comparison: PASS`: the run matched the reference within the
  built-in tolerances.
- `final-state comparison: FAIL`: at least one checked field exceeded tolerance.
  The first failure is printed, and detailed failures are written to
  `final_state_comparison_failures_<backend>.csv`.

The process exits with status `0` on successful integration and, when enabled,
successful final-state comparison. It exits nonzero if integration fails,
argument parsing fails, an output file cannot be written, or comparison fails.
